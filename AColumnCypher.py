# Column Cypher
# =============
# 
A column cipher works by writing the message in rows of a fixed length, and then extracting the columns and concatenating them.  So the message
"THISISACOLUMNCYPHER" with rows of length 5, would be written::
 
#     THISI
#     SACOL
#     UMNCY
#     PHERX

and then be sent as "TSUPHAMHICNESOCRILYX".  Note that you want to pad the message with extra characters to make it a multiple of the number of columns.
# 
In this exercise we will use numpy multidimensional arrays to encode a message as a column cypher.

5. When you index the transposed array, you should get a row of the array. For example, <array>[0] should be the first row of characters.

Declare a new variable that will store the encoded message, and set it to an empty string. Loop through the rows of the array. Use ''.join(<array>) to convert the array of characters to a string. Then add that string to the encoded message. Print the final result.
